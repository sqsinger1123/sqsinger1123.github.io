Welcome to my site.

Lets Play Two Truths and a Lie.

The rules are simple. I'll offer you three fun facts about myself. Two are true, and one is a lie! Take your best guess as to which one is a lie. Then expand each story below to learn more â€“ and learn whether I'm telling the truth!

Round one: My 2 Truths and 1 Lie:
1. I married the same person 4 times.
1. I have visited every National Park in the USA.
1. I ran a marathon, and it was Boston 2013.

Read on, and expand each accordion below to see which is the lie. Did I fool you?

                    <p><strong>It's true!</strong></p>
                    <p>My wife Julia and I had four separate wedding ceremonies, to include friends and family in different parts of the world: Toronto, Ontario, Canada â€“ a hybrid event in July 2014! We hosted a civil ceremony including local guests in-person, with several others joining on Skype. Qingdao, Shandong, China â€“ with Julia's maternal grandparents, relatives, and friends. A seafood banquet. Shanghai, China â€“ with Julia's paternal grandparents, relatives, and friends. A wonderful urban adventure. Wilmington, Delaware, USA â€“ the big party with most of our North American friends. Now we have 4 anniversaries to celebrate!

                    <p><strong>No, it's false.</strong></p>
                    <p>At least as of writing this in 2022, and reviewing it in 2025, I have not been to every national park in the USA. But I have visited several national parks! My wife and I love getting out to explore nature, seeing new places, and collecting stamps. We are often up for a new hiking adventure. We decorate our home with maps collected from our travels â€“ nice reminders of our favorite places. Pictured: we are posing at Moraine Lake in Banff. That's a Canadian National Park! That may have been a hint. ðŸ˜‰ We have visited quite a few national parks in the States as well â€“ with Death Valley, Lassen, Acadia, and Canyonlands all standing out in their own ways.</p>

                    <p>That was a memorable day: wonderful and terrible at once. I wrote about it, and you can [read my story here](https://blog.sqsinger.com/2013/04/17/boston-marathon-2013/).</p>

Ok that was pretty great. Thanks for playing. One more round? Alright, sure. Try out these 2 truths and a lie:
1. As a certified scuba instructor, I have logged over 500 dives. 
1. As of today (Nov 15, 2022), I have a 401-day streak on Duolingo.
1. In high school, I played the piano, trombone, and trumpet.

                    <p>Not even close. I have never gone scuba diving. However, I used to do a different kind of diving â€“ the kind from a one-meter springboard. And I was pretty ok. Top 10 in the state of Delaware. It's a small state.

                    <p><strong>True.</strong></p>
                    <p>I am studying Mandarin Chinese and have been at it consistently for 401 days as of writing this on Nov 15, 2022. I've also used Duolingo to improve my Spanish, French, Latin, and Italian. But I've spent the most time learning Mandarin, to better connect with my wife's family. Duolingo learning Mandarin</p>

                    <p>I first learned piano, then trombone, then trumpet. I can play all three, but not skillfully anymore. As of high school, I was actively playing all three on a regular basis. Nowadays, I play some improvisational piano and compose music, just for fun.
